# Contributing guide

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow in AQUA, from opening an *issue*, creating a *Pull Request* (PR), reviewing, and merging the PR.

We welcome contributions to the AQUA project in many forms, and there's always plenty to do!

## Pull Requests

The contribution workflow is based on Pull Requests (PR). 
A Pull Request is a request to merge a set of changes into the `main` branch of the repository. 
It is the main way to contribute to AQUA.

Please note that the `main` branch is *not* protected. 
Anyway, pushing directly to `main` is forbidden and if not agreed in advance, your changes will be reverted.
Please use Pull Requests instead.

## Reporting issues

Before opening an issue, please [search the if the issue already exists][https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments]. If it does, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

As a general rule, if you are unsure, please open an issue anyway and we will help you.
There is no automatic assignement of issues to anyone. 
If you want to work on an issue, please comment on it and we will assign it to you.
If you open a pull request to close some issues, please reference the issue it solves in the description.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by opening an issue in the AQUA repository. 
If you have a solution to it, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. 
Please use the `bug` label for bugs issue and the `fix` label for Pull Requests with a fix.

When describing the bug, please include as much information as possible. This includes:
- short description of the bug
- steps to reproduce the bug
- machine you are using

### Suggesting enhancements

Enhancements of existing features or new features may be suggested by opening an issue in the AQUA repository. Please use the `improvements` label for existing features and the `enhancement` label for new features.
