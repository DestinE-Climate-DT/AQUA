# AQUA

The Application for QUality Assessment (AQUA) is a model evaluation framework designed for running diagnostics on high-resolution climate models, specifically for Climate DT climate simulations being part of Destination Earth activity. The package provides a flexible and efficient python3 framework to process and analyze large volumes of climate data. With its modular design, AQUA offers seamless integration of core functions and a wide range of diagnostic tools that can be run in parallel. AQUA offers:

- Efficient handling of large datasets from high-resolution climate models;
- Support for various data formats, such as NetCDF, GRIB, Zarr or FDB;
- Robust and fast regridding functionality based on CDO;
- Averaging and aggregation tools for temporal and spatial analyses;
- Modular design for easy integration of new diagnostics. 

## Installation

AQUA requires python>=3.9. Recommended installation should be done through any package manager for conda-forge.

### Create conda/mamba environment and install packages
```
git clone git@github.com:DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA.git
cd AQUA
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate aqua
```

This installation will provide both the AQUA framework and the AQUA diagnostics.

### Use of AQUA container 

An alternative deployment making use of containers is available. Please refer to the `Container` chapter in the [AQUA Documentation](https://aqua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container.html).
