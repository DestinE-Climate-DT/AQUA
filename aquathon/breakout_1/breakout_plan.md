# Breakout Session Plan: AQUA Analysis and Catalog Management

## Agenda Overview
This session will cover the following key topics:
1. **Sailing with AQUA:** Running the aqua-analysis, modifying configuration files, submitting jobs, and interpreting outputs.

## Session Structure

### 1. **Introduction and Overview (1 min)**
   - Brief introduction to the session objectives.

### 2. **Demonstration in the Notebook (20 min)**
   - **Objective:** Provide a live demonstration using a Jupyter notebook.
   - **Steps:**
     - Walk through a typical analysis workflow (Ocean3D, Global mean time series, Atmospheric global mean biases diagnostics).
     - Highlight key functions and their outputs.
     - Encourage participants to follow along and ask questions in real-time.

### 3. **Running and Submitting AQUA Analyses (20 min)**
   - **Objective:** Demonstrate how to run aqua-analysis, modify the YAML file, submit analyses, and review outputs.
   - **Steps:**
     - Show how to run the aqua-analysis tool and its role in diagnostics.
     - Explain common troubleshooting techniques.
     - Walk through modifying the YAML file for custom analyses.
     - Demonstrate how to submit jobs using the `./cli/aqua-web/submit-aqua-web.py` script for parallel aqua-web SLURM jobs.
     - Review and interpret the output generated by aqua_analysis (including logs, PDF reports, NetCDF files).

### 4. **Q&A Session (5 min)**
   - Open the floor for questions.
   - Address any issues or clarify doubts regarding the session content.
   - Encourage feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Closing Remarks (Optional)
   - Recap the session’s key points.
   - Provide additional resources or references for further learning.
   - Thank participants for their time and engagement.

### 6. aqua_analysis Output and Discussion (5 min)

#### Overview
The `output` folder is organized to provide a clear, hierarchical structure of the analysis results. Each layer in the folder structure adds context to the data, making it easier to navigate and interpret.

#### Folder Structure Explanation

- **Model Level:**
  - The top-level directories represent different models or simulations.
- **Experiment Level:**
  - Within each model directory, you will find subdirectories corresponding to different experiments or simulation periods.
- **Diagnostic Level:**
  - Each experiment folder contains diagnostics, organized by their respective categories, such as time series, seasonal cycles, or specific climate phenomena.
- **Output Files:**
  - Inside diagnostic folders, you’ll find various output files:
    - **Log files** to trace the analysis process.
    - **PDF reports** providing visual summaries.
    - **NetCDF files** containing detailed data for further analysis.

#### Discussion Points
- **Navigating the Structure:** Understanding the hierarchy helps quickly locate the relevant analysis results.
- **Interpreting Output:** Discuss how the organization aids in comparing results across different experiments and diagnostics.
- **Utilizing Logs and Data:** Logs are essential for troubleshooting, while NetCDF files are key for in-depth analysis.
