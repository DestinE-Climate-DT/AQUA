### 6. aqua_analysis Output and Discussion (5 min)

#### Overview
The `output` folder is organized to provide a clear, hierarchical structure of the analysis results. Each layer in the folder structure adds context to the data, making it easier to navigate and interpret.

#### Folder Structure Explanation

- **Model Level:**
  - The top-level directories represent different models or simulations.
- **Experiment Level:**
  - Within each model directory, you will find subdirectories corresponding to different experiments or simulation periods.
- **Diagnostic Level:**
  - Each experiment folder contains diagnostics, organized by their respective categories, such as time series, seasonal cycles, or specific climate phenomena.
- **Output Files:**
  - Inside diagnostic folders, youâ€™ll find various output files:
    - **Log files** to trace the analysis process.
    - **PDF reports** providing visual summaries.
    - **NetCDF files** containing detailed data for further analysis.

#### Discussion Points
- **Navigating the Structure:** Understanding the hierarchy helps quickly locate the relevant analysis results.
- **Interpreting Output:** Discuss how the organization aids in comparing results across different experiments and diagnostics.
- **Utilizing Logs and Data:** Logs are essential for troubleshooting, while NetCDF files are key for in-depth analysis.
