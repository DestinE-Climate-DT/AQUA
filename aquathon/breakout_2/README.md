Welcome to Breakout 2 of the AQUAthon event! If you see this file (and this is what you are interested in), then you're in the right place.

## Event Details

Date: 12th of September 2024  
Time: 15:45 CEST
Link: Please join the general session and then select breakout room 2: [zoom](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.bbb_corsi.waitRoom?id=59903&p_tipo=DOCENTE)

This is a hands-on session where we will explore some deeper (more advanced) aspects of AQUA. In particular, we will focus on direct FDB access, dask, parallelization, streaming access, the fixer and, time permitting, some advanced details about grids. The session is chaired by **[Jost von Hardenberg](jost.hardenberg@polito.it)**.

If you need any help, feel free to ask during the session or check out the provided resources. Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing you there!
