# The key 'component' is used to determine the specific type of grid fixes to apply
# (defined in cdopipe for now)
# 
# We also have the concept of 'domain' (atm or oce) later used to choose which fix to apply
# Each component belongs to one and only one domain

# areafile: where the grid cell area is
# please not that for both grid area computation and itnerpolation weight computation
# the code will look in priority from areafile to gridfile to maskfile. 
# inifile can be formatted with all the possible keywords listed above
