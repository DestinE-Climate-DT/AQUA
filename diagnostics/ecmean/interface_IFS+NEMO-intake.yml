# Configuration yaml file for EC-Earth4 model and variables
# 
# Possible filetype attributes for variables are defined in the model section
# The full path is $basedir/$dir/$filename
# 
# basedir can be formatted with: expname
# dir can be formatted with: expname
# filename can be formatted with: expname, year1, year2, var
#
# The key 'component' is used to determine the specific type of grid fixes to apply
# (defined in cdopipe for now)
# 
# We also have the concept of 'domain' (atm or oce) later used to choose which fix to apply
# Each component belongs to one and only one domain

# Definition of model name and components belonging to it
model:
  basedir: '{expname}'
  component:
    atm: cmoratm
    oce: cmoroce

# Definition of filetypes (specific for each component)
# Each variable belongs to a filetype
filetype: 
  atmbase:
    filename: '*.nc'
    dir: ''
    component: cmoratm
  ocebase:

    component: cmoroce

# Specify additional inifiles  of each component
# maskfile: where the land-sea mask is, fundamental for atmospheric component 
# gridfile: where the properties of the grid can be extracted, can be a standard file
# areafile: where the grid cell area is
# please not that for both grid area computation and itnerpolation weight computation
# the code will look in priority from areafile to gridfile to maskfile. 
# inifile can be formatted with all the possible keywords listed above
# If a relative path is used this is attached to $ECEDIR/$basedir
