# Configuration yaml file for EC-Earth4 model and variables
# 
# Possible filetype attributes for variables are defined in the model section
# The full path is $basedir/$dir/$filename
# 
# basedir can be formatted with: expname
# dir can be formatted with: expname
# filename can be formatted with: expname, year1, year2, var
#
# The key 'component' is used to determine the specific type of grid fixes to apply
# (defined in cdopipe for now)
# 
# We also have the concept of 'domain' (atm or oce) later used to choose which fix to apply
# Each component belongs to one and only one domain

# Definition of model name and components belonging to it

# Definition of filetypes (specific for each component)
# Each variable belongs to a filetype
