# Cycle3 analysis CLI setup

This folder contains the setup that has been used to run the cycle3 analysis with the CLI on levante.
Two files, one for NAO and one for ENSO teleconnection, are provided. 
They contain the list of the experiments that have been run, which specific source has been used for the data, together with technical information on the setup of the analysis, like resolution, time aggregation, etc.

If you'd like to run the analysis on your own, you can use these files as a template, please note that you will need to change the paths to the data and the output folder to not overwrite the existing results.
