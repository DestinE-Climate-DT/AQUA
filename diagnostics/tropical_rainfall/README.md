# Diagnostic of tropical rainfalls

The tropical-rainfall diagnostic analyzes rainfall variability in the tropical zone and compares the climatological models' predictions with observations.  

## Description

The module comprises Python-implemented source files, an environment file, tests, demonstration files, and a command line interface. You can find a detailed description of the module in the aqua documentation. 

Below you can find a quick start to the tropical_rainfall diagnostic.

## Installation Instructions

### Installation on Levante


`env-tropical-rainfall.yml` file contains the minimal requirement for tropical diagnostic. 


You can create the environment with the use of conda

```
conda env create -f diagnostics/tropical_rainfall/env-tropical-rainfall.yml
```

or with mamba
```
conda env create -f diagnostics/tropical_rainfall/env-tropical-rainfall.yml
```

### Installation on Lumi


The easiest way to install the diagnostic is by using the pip installation method and adding the following packages
- fast_histogram
- boost_histogram
- dask_histogram

to the list of pip packages in the aqua installation script, which is located in the folder `/config/machines/lumi/installation/`.

## Data requirements  

The following are the requirements for input climatological data:
Data must include the precipitation rate variable (**tprate**) in a latitude and longitude grid. 


## Output 

All output of the diagnostic is in the format of NetCDF or PDF.
Folder where to store the output can be specified by the user.

## Examples

The **notebook/** folder contains the following notebooks:
 - **histogram_calculation.ipynb**: 

    The notebook demonstrates the major abilities of tropical rainfall diagnostic: 
    - initialization of an object of the diagnostic class, 
    - selection of the class attributes,  
    - calculation of the histograms in the form of xarray, 
    - saving the histograms in the storage,
    - and loading the histograms from storage.
 - **histogram_plotting.ipynb**:

    The notebook demonstrates the abilities of the histogram plotting functions:
    - selection of the plot style: step line style, 2D smooth line style, and different color maps,
    - selection of the plot size, axes scales, 
    - saving plot into storage, 
    - plotting the counts, frequencies, and Probability density function (pdf) from the obtained histograms.
 - **diagnostic_vs_streaming.ipynb**:

    The notebook demonstrates the usage of diagnostic during the streaming mode:
    - saving the obtained histogram with the histogram into storage per each chunk of any data during the stream, 
    - loading all or multiple histograms from storage and merging them into a single histogram. 

 - **comparison_of_lowres_models.ipynb**:

    The notebook demonstrates:
    - histogram comparison for different climate models,
    - the ability to merge a few separate plots into a single one, 
    - mean of tropical and global precipitation calculations for different climate models,
    - bias between climatological model and observations.
