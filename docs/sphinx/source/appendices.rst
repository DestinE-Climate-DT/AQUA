Appendices
==========

This section contains supplementary information related to the AQUA package, such as additional configuration options, advanced use cases, and technical details.

Appendix A: Configuration Options
---------------------------------

This appendix provides an overview of configuration options available in AQUA. These options allow users to customize the package's behavior to better suit their needs.

1. Data file format options:
   - `data_file_format`: Specify the file format of the climate data (e.g., NetCDF, GRIB, HDF).
   - `variable_names_map`: Define a mapping of variable names from the input data to standard variable names used in AQUA.

2. Interpolation and regridding options:
   - `interpolation_method`: Select the interpolation method to be used (e.g., bilinear, nearest-neighbor, conservative).
   - `regridding_method`: Choose the regridding method to be applied (e.g., ESMF).

3. Parallel processing options:
   - `parallel_mode`: Choose the parallel processing mode (e.g., multithreading, multiprocessing, distributed computing).
   - `num_threads`: Specify the number of threads to use in multithreading mode.
   - `num_processes`: Specify the number of processes to use in multiprocessing mode.

Appendix B: Advanced Use Cases
------------------------------

This appendix covers advanced use cases of AQUA, such as working with large datasets, optimizing performance, and integrating with other tools and platforms.

1. Working with large datasets: Tips and tricks for managing memory and optimizing performance when working with large climate datasets.
2. Performance optimization: Techniques to further improve the performance of AQUA, such as using Dask for out-of-core and distributed computing.
3. Integration with other tools and platforms: Guidelines for using AQUA alongside other data analysis and visualization libraries, or integrating it into existing workflows and platforms.

Appendix C: Technical Details
------------------------------

This appendix contains technical details about AQUA's implementation, including its underlying algorithms, data structures, and external dependencies.

1. Algorithms: Detailed descriptions of the algorithms used in AQUA, such as interpolation, regridding, and diagnostics.
2. Data structures: Information on the xarray data structures used to represent and manipulate climate data in AQUA.
3. External dependencies: List and description of external libraries and tools used by AQUA (e.g., xarray, numpy, dask).
