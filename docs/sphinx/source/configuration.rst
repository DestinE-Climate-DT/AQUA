Configuration
=============

AQUA is based on a configuration folder `config` which includes a few different files, both local and machine-dependent. 
The `config.yml` includes the most important path to be stored

Then, machine-dependent folders are used to specify the properties of the data access and of the AQUA functions, as the interpolation features.
