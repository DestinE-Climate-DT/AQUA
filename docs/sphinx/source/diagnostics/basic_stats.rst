Basic statistics
================

This diagnostic package includes three python notebooks to plot basic statistics from the NextGEMS simulations (Cycle 2) using the Low Resolution Archive (LRA). 
Three simulations are considered: "tco2559-ng5" and "tco1279-orca025" for IFS, and "ngc2009" for ICON, 
with the resolution provided by the LRA (monthly data, 1x1 regular grid). Notebooks and files included are:

- global_temp.ipynb: notebook to compute and plot global mean 2 metre temperature.
- precipitation.ipynb: notebook to
