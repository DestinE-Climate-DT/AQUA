Global mean time series
=======================

Description
-----------

This diagnostic computes and plots various (atmospheric) global mean time series.

Structure
-----------

* `README.md`: a readme file which contains some technical information on how to install the diagnostic and its environment.
* `functions.py`: a python file in which the `plot_timeseries()` and `plot_gregory` functions are implemented
* `notebooks/global_time_series.ipynb`: an ipython notebook which shows the usage of both functions
* `cli/cli_global_time_series.py`: a CLI to run the diagnostic in an automated way
* `cli/config.yaml`: a configuration file to configure the CLI

Input variables example
------------------------

* `2t`     (2 metre temperature, GRIB paramid 167)
* `mtntrf`     (Outgoing longwave radiation at TOA, GRIB paramid 172179)
* `mtnsrf`     (Net shortwave radiation at TOA, GRIB paramid 172178)

Output
------

The diagnostic producestwo plots:

* `timeseries.png`  A comparison of ICON and IFS global mean temperature
* `gregory.png`     A Gregory-like plot to analyse model drift in ICON

and two data files:

* `icon_2t_mean.nc` Data for Gregory-like plot to analyse model drift in ICON
* `ifs_2t_mean.nc`  Data for Gregory-like plot to analyse model drift in ICON

Observations
------------

The diagnostic has an optional dependence on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset.

Example Plot(s)
---------------

.. figure:: figures/global_mean_timeseries.png
    :width: 10cm

    Comparison of global mean air temperature in IFS, ICON, and the ERA5 reanalysis for NextGEMS Cycle3 simulations.

Available demo notebooks
------------------------

Notebooks are stored in diagnostics/global_time_series/notebooks

* `global_mean_time_series.ipynb <https://github.com/oloapinivad/AQUA/blob/main/diagnostics/global_time_series/notebooks/global_mean_time_series.ipynb>`_

Detailed API
------------

This section provides a detailed reference for the Application Programming Interface (API) of the "global_mean_timeseries" diagnostic,
produced from the diagnostic function docstrings.
