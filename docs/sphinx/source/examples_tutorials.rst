Jupyter Notebooks for Various Use Cases
---------------------------------------

AQUA provides a collection of Jupyter notebooks to help users explore and understand its capabilities. These notebooks cover a range of use cases, from basic examples to advanced applications. Some example notebooks include:

1. Basic data processing and visualization
2. Interpolation and regridding techniques
3. Temporal and spatial averaging
4. Running built-in diagnostics
5. Creating and running custom diagnostics
6. Parallel execution of diagnostics
7. Advanced visualization and analysis

To access the example notebooks, visit the AQUA GitHub repository or refer to the package documentation.

Advanced Examples
------------------

In addition to the Jupyter notebooks, AQUA also provides advanced examples that demonstrate complex workflows and integrations with other Python libraries. These examples can serve as a starting point for users to develop their own customized diagnostic pipelines. Some advanced examples include:

- Multi-model ensemble analysis
- Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis
- Integration with machine learning libraries for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction
- Coupling with external tools for advanced visualization and data management

Tips and Best Practices
-----------------------

When using AQUA, consider the following tips and best practices to ensure optimal performance and usability:

1. Use a virtual environment to isolate the AQUA installation and its dependencies.
2. Familiarize yourself with xarray data structures and operations, as they form the basis of AQUA's data handling capabilities.
3. Always preprocess and regrid your data before running diagnostics to ensure consistent results.
4. Run diagnostics in parallel whenever possible to reduce computational time.
5. Use the provided Jupyter notebooks as a starting point for your own analyses, and customize them to suit your specific needs.
6. Consult the AQUA documentation and API reference for detailed information on available functions and
