Getting Started
===============

Basic Concepts
--------------

AQUA is designed to simplify the diagnostics process on high-resolution climate models. 
This is done by creating a series of tools that simplifies data access and basic data operations so that the 
users - diagnostics developers or climate researchers interested in accessing model data - can focus only on scientific analysis.
For this reason, whatever object accessed by AQUA is delivered as a `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_ object.
The package is built around a few core concepts:

- **Data reading and preprocessing**: Data are exposed through `intake <https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ catalogues 
  and represented as `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_ objects. 
  This allows us to easily read and preprocess data from various sources, including local files, remote servers, 
  and cloud storage, from climate models and observational datasets.
- **Data fixing**: AQUA provides capabilities to change metadata (e.g., variable names) and data themselves
  (e.g., convert to different units or homogeneize coordinate names) so that model data reach the users with a common data format.
- **Regridding and interpolation**: AQUA offers robust regridding and interpolation functionalities 
  to align datasets with different grids and spatial resolutions.
- **Averaging and aggregation**: AQUA provides tools to perform temporal and spatial averaging and aggregation of climate data.
- **Parallel processing**: AQUA supports parallel processing through `dask <https://examples.dask.org/xarray.html>`_ to 
  speed up the execution of diagnostics.
- **Lazy evaluation**: AQUA uses `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_ to represent data, 
  which allows for lazy evaluation of operations, meaning that the data are not loaded into memory until they are needed.
- **Diagnostics**: most importantly, AQUA includes a set of built-in diagnostic tools,
  and it allows users to create custom diagnostics as well.

Installation
------------

Installation can be done using `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Containers and tools specific to the machines used in the project are available.
Please refer to the :ref:`installation` section for more information.

.. _initialization:

Catalogue Installation
----------------------

After the package has been installed, or the container has been loaded, the AQUA catalogue needs to be set up.
This means to set up the configuration file and the catalogue, with a copy or a link to the necessary files.
This needs to be done only once, unless catalogues or fix and grid files are added or need to be updated/removed.

.. note::
  A more complete description of the available commands can be found in the :ref:`aqua-console` section.

Set up the configuration folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration folder contains configuration files and the catalogues added to the AQUA package.
To set up the configuration folder, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    aqua install

This command will create the configuration folder in the ``$HOME/.aqua`` directory and it will copy there the essential files.
Check the :ref:`aqua-install` section for more information.

Add a catalogue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A catalogue is a folder containing the YAML files that describe the data available in the catalogue.

.. note::
  At the actual state of the AQUA package, the catalogues coincide with the machines on which you are working.
  This means that you will need to install only the catalogue of the machine you are working on.

To add a catalogue, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    aqua add <catalog>

For example, to add the catalogue of the machine ``lumi``, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    aqua add lumi

This command will copy the catalogue folder to the configuration folder.

Set up Jupyter kernel
---------------------

You need to register the kernel for the aqua environment to work with the AQUA 
package in Jupyter Hub on HPC systems.

Activate the environment and register the kernel with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba activate aqua
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=aqua

.. warning::

    On lumi you cannot use mamba or conda to install the environment, so that this step is not possible.
    Please refer to the :ref:`container` section if you are working from a container
    or the :ref:`installation` section for more information on how to install AQUA
    specifically on lumi.

Example use case
----------------

Now that AQUA is installed in our favourite machine, let's see how to use it.
We will explore here a little example using the AQUA framework.
No diagnostic is involved here, this can be found in the :ref:`diagnostics` section.

We will walk you through an example using AQUA to interpolate atmospherically
temperature data to 1°x1° grid, plot a timestep of it and
then calculate the mean global temperature time series on the original grid.
This can be done in a few lines of code and using a Jupyter notebook.

Let's start with retrieving the data from the catalogue.

.. code-block:: python

    from aqua import Reader

We then instantiate the reader object.
To access a catalogue entry, a three layer structure is used: ``model``, ``exp`` and ``source``.
While doing so we specify the target grid to which we want to interpolate the data
and we turn on fixing of the data, so that the data are delivered in a common format.
Notice that ``fix=True`` is the default option, so we could have omitted it.

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS-NEMO", exp="historical-1990", source="hourly-hpz7-atm2d",
                    regrid='r100', fix=True)

This will create a reader object that will allow us to access the data from the catalogue.
Data are not retrieved yet at this stage and eventually we can specify variables and time range while accessing the data.

We now retrieve the data.

.. code-block:: python

    data = reader.retrieve()

We are asking for the data to be retrieved and a xarray object is returned,
so that only metadata are loaded into memory.
This allows us to retrieve blindly the data, without worrying about the size of the data.
We can then, in the development stage, explore the data and see what we have.
In a production environment instead, AQUA can be used to retrieve only variables and time ranges of interest.

.. note::
  Data are retrieved as an xarray object, specifically a ``xarray.Dataset``, even in the case we asked for a single variable.

We can now interpolate the data to a 1°x1° grid and plot a timestep of it, all with AQUA tools.

.. code-block:: python

    data_2t_r = reader.regrid(data['2t']) # This is an xarray.DataArray
    data_2t_r.isel(time=0).aqua.plot_single_map()

We obtain as image:

.. image:: figures/getting_started_map.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

We used the regrid method to interpolate the data to a 1°x1° grid, with preprocessing of the weights already done
while initializating the Reader.
We then used the ``plot_single_map()`` function to plot the first timestep of the data.
This function has been used as accessor but can also be called as a standalone function.
See :ref:`accessors` for more information.

We can now calculate the mean global temperature time series on the original grid.
We will then go back to use the original data, without regridding them,
to show area evaluation capabilities of AQUA.

.. code-block:: python

    global_mean = reader.fldmean(data['2t'].isel(time=slice(100,200)))
    global_mean.plot()

We obtain as image:

.. image:: figures/getting_started_timeseries.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

or explore the Jupyter notebooks provided with AQUA.
