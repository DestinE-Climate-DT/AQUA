Overview of AQUA
----------------

AQUA (Climate DT Applications for Quality assessment, and Uncertainty quAntification)
 is a model evaluation framework designed for running diagnostics on high-resolution climate models,  
 also known as Digital Twins of Earth. The package provides a flexible and efficient framework to process 
 and analyze large volumes of climate data. 
 With its modular design, AQUA offers seamless integration of core functions and a wide range of diagnostic 
 tools that can be run in parallel.

Purpose and Scope
-----------------

The purpose of AQUA is to streamline the diagnostic process for high-resolution climate models, 
making it easier for researchers and scientists to analyze and interpret climate data. 
AQUA aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for data preparation 
and running diagnostics on climate model outputs.

Key Features
------------

- Efficient handling of large datasets from high-resolution climate models
- Support for various data formats, such as NetCDF, GRIB, and HDF
- Robust and fast regridding functionality
- Averaging and aggregation tools for temporal and spatial analyses
- Modular design for easy integration of new diagnostics
