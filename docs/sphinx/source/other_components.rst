Other core functionalities
==========================

Time Statistics
---------------

Input data may not be available at the desired time frequency. It is possible to perform time statistics, including
time averaging, minimum, maximum and standard deviation at a given time frequency by using the ``timstat()`` method and its sibilings
``timmean()``, ``timmin()``, ``timmax()`` and ``timstd()``. 

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp="tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d")
    data = reader.retrieve()
    daily = reader.timmean(data, freq='daily')
    # alternatively: daily = reader.timstat(data, stat='mean', freq='daily')

Data have now been averaged at the desired daily timescale. Similarly operations can be performed with others methods.

.. warning::
    If you do not specify the ``freq`` argument, the statistical operation will be operated on the entire dataset!

Some extra options are available:

- ``exclude_incomplete=True``: this flag will remove averaged chunks which are not complete
  (for example, verify  that all the record from each month are available before doing the time mean).
- ``center_time=True``: this flag will center the time coordinate on the mean time window.
- ``time_bounds=True``: this flag can be activated to build time bounds in a similar way to CMOR-like standard.


Detrending
----------

For some analysis, removing from the data a linear trend can be helpful to highlight the internal variability.
The ``detrend`` method can be used as a high-level wrapper of xarray functionalities to achieve this goal.

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp="tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d")
    data = reader.retrieve()
    daily = reader.detrend(data['2t'], dim='time')

In this way, linear trend is removed from each grid point of the original dataset along the time dimension. 
Other dimension can be targeted too, although with limited physical meaning. 
Of course, it can be used in collaboration with temporal and spatial averaging. Higher order polynominial fits are available too.

Some options includes:

- ``degree``: this will define with an integer the order of the polynominial fit. Default is 1, i.e. linear detrending.
- ``skipna=True``: removing the NaN from the fit. Default is ``True``. 

.. warning::
    Detrending might lead to incorrect results if there is not an equal amount of time elements (e.g. same amount of months or days) in the dataset.


Spatial Averaging
-----------------

When we instantiate the ``Reader`` object, grid areas for the source files are computed if not already available. 
After this, we can use them for spatial averaging using the ``fldmean()`` method, obtaining time series of global (field) averages.
For example, if we run the following commands:

.. code-block:: python

    tprate = data.tprate
    global_mean = reader.fldmean(tprate)

we get a time series of the global average ``tprate``.

It is also possible to apply a regional section to the domain before performing the averaging:

.. code-block:: python

    tprate = data.tprate
    global_mean = reader.fldmean(tprate, lon_limits=[-50, 50], lat_limits=[-10,20])

.. warning ::
    In order to apply an area selection the data Xarray must include ``lon`` and ``lat`` as coordinates.
    It can work also on unstructured grids, but information on coordinates must be available.
    If the dataset does not include these coordinates, this can be achieved with the fixer
    described in the :ref:`fixer` section.

.. _time-selection:

Time selection
--------------

Even if slicing your data after the ``retrieve()`` method is an easy task,
being able to perform a time selecetion during the Reader initialization
can speed up your code, having less metadata to explore.
For this reason ``startdate`` and ``enddate`` options are available both
during the Reader initialization and the ``retrieve()`` method to subselect
immediatly only a chunck of data.

.. note::
    If you're streaming data check the section :ref:`streaming` to have an
    overview of the behaviour of the Reader with these options.

.. _lev-selection:

Level selection
---------------

Similarly to :ref:`time-selection`, level selection is a trivial operation,
but when dealing with high-resolution 3D datasets, only ask for the
required levels can speed up the retrieve process.

When reading 3D data it is possible to specify already during ``retrieve()``
which levels to select using the ``level`` keyword.
The levels are specified in the same units as they are stored in the archive
(for example in hPa for atmospheric IFS data,
but an index for NEMO data in the FDB archive).

.. note::
    In the case of FDB data this presents the great advantage that a significantly reduced request will be read from the FDB 
    (by default all levels would be read for each timestep even if later a ``sel()`` or ``isel()`` selection
    is performed on the XArray).

.. warning::
    If you're dealing with level selection and regridding, please take a look at 
    the section :ref:`lev-selection-regrid`.

.. _streaming:

Streaming of data
-----------------

The Reader class includes the ability to simulate data streaming to retrieve chunks
of data of a specific time length.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

To activate the streaming mode the user should specify the argument ``streaming=True``
in the Reader initialization.
The user can also choose the length of the data chunk with the ``aggregation`` keyword
(e.g. in pandas notation, or with aliases as ``daily``, ``monthly`` etc. or ``days``, ``months`` etc.).
The default is ``S`` (step), i.e. single saved timesteps are read at each iteration.
The user can also specify the desired initial and final dates with the keywords ``startdate`` and ``enddate``.

If, for example, we want to stream the data every three days from ``'2020-05-01'``, we need to call:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp= "tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d",
                    streaming=True, aggregation = '3D', startdate = '2020-05-01')    
    data = reader.retrieve()

The data available with the first retrieve will be only 3 days of the available times.
The ``retrieve()`` method can then be called multiple times,
returning a new chunk of 3 days of data, until all data are streamed.
The function will automatically determine the appropriate start and end points for each chunk based on
the internal state of the streaming process.

If we want to reset the state of the streaming process, we can call the ``reset_stream()`` method.

Iterator streaming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another possibility to deal with data streaming is to use the argument
``stream_generator=True`` in the Reader initialization:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp= "tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d",
                    stream_generator = 'True', aggregation = 'monthly')
    data_gen = reader.retrieve()
    
``data_gen`` is now a generator object that yields the requested one-month-long chunks of data
(See :ref:`iterators` for more info).
We can do operations with them by iterating on the generator object like:

.. code-block:: python

    for data in data_gen:
        # Do something with the data

.. _accessors:

Accessors
---------

AQUA also provides a special ``aqua`` accessor to Xarray which allows
to call most functions and methods of the reader
class as if they were methods of a DataArray or Dataset.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Reader methods like ``reader.regrid()`` or functions like ``plot_single_map()``
can now also be accessed by appending the suffix ``aqua`` to a
DataArray or Dataset, followed by the function of interest,
like in ``data.aqua.regrid()``.

This means that instead of writing:

.. code-block:: python

    reader.fldmean(reader.timmean(data.tcc, freq="Y"))

we can write:

.. code-block:: python

    data.tcc.aqua.timmean(freq="Y").aqua.fldmean()

.. note::
    The accessor always assumes that the Reader instance to be used is either
    the one with which a Dataset was created or, for new derived objects and for **DataArrays of a Datasets**,
    the last instantiated Reader or the last use of the ``retrieve()`` method.
    This means that if more than one reader instance is used (for example to compare different datasets)
    we recommend not to use the accessor.

Usage with multiple Reader instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative the Reader class contains a special ``set_default()`` method which sets that reader
as an accessor default in the following.
The accessor itself also has a ``set_default()`` method
(accepting a reader instance as an argument) which sets the default and returns the same object.

Usage examples when multiple readers are used:

.. code-block:: python

    from aqua import Reader
    reader1=Reader(model="IFS", exp="test-tco79", source="short", regrid="r100")  # the default is now reader1
    reader2=Reader(model="IFS", exp="test-tco79", source="short", regrid="r200")  # the default is now reader2
    data1 = reader1.retrieve()  # the default is now reader1 
    data2 = reader2.retrieve()  # the default is now reader2
    reader1.set_default()  # the default is now reader1 
    data1r = data1.aqua.regrid()
    data2r = data2.aqua.regrid()  # data2 was created by retrieve(), so it remembers its default reader
    data2r = data2['2t'].aqua.set_default(reader2).aqua.regrid()  # the default is set to reader2 before using a method

Parallel Processing
-------------------

Since most of the objects in AQUA are based on ``xarray``, you can use parallel processing capabilities provided by 
``xarray`` through integration with ``dask`` to speed up the execution of data processing tasks.

For example, if you are working with AQUA interactively
in a Jupyter Notebook, you can start a dask cluster to parallelize your computations.

.. code-block:: python

    from dask.distributed import Client
    import dask
    dask.config.config.get('distributed').get('dashboard').update({'link':'{JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX}/proxy/{port}/status'})

    client = Client(n_workers=40, threads_per_worker=1, memory_limit='5GB')
    client

The above code will start a dask cluster with 40 workers and one thread per worker.

AQUA also provides a simple way to move the computation done by dask to a compute node on your HPC system.
The description of this feature is provided in the section :ref:`slurm`.

.. _data-provenance:

Data provenance
---------------

The implementation of data provenance is under development and only basic functionalities are available.
A set of metadata is stored as ``AQUA_metadata_name`` in the attributes of the ``xarray.Dataset`` retrieved by the ``Reader``.
The metadata includes information about the model, experiment, source and AQUA version used to retrieve the data.

Additionally the ``history`` attribute is updated with details of the operations performed on the data.
This is done by the ``Reader`` and it is under implementation for diagnostics as well.

A function ``log_history`` is available in the ``aqua.logger`` module to log in this attribute for a specific dataset.
This can be used as well to log the history of the operations performed on the data in custom scripts.

.. _graphic-tools:

Graphic tools
-------------

The *aqua.graphics* module provides a set of simple functions to easily plot the result of analysis done within AQUA.

Single map
^^^^^^^^^^

A function called ``plot_single_map()`` is provided with many options to customize the plot.

The function takes as input an xarray.DataArray, with a single timestep to be selected
before calling the function. The function will then plot the map of the variable and,
if no other option is provided, will adapt colorbar, title and labels to the attributes
of the input DataArray.

In the following example we plot an sst map from the first timestep of ERA5 reanalysis:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from aqua import Reader, plot_single_map

    reader = Reader(model='ERA5', exp='era5', source='monthly')
    sst = reader.retrieve(var=["sst"])
    sst_plot = sst["sst"].isel(time=0)

    plot_single_map(sst_plot, title="Example of a custom title", filename="example",
                    outputdir=".", format="png", dpi=300, save=True)

This will produce the following plot:

.. figure:: figures/single_map_example.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

Single map with differences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A function called ``plot_single_map_diff()`` is provided with many options to customize the plot.

The function is built as an expansion of the ``plot_single_map()`` function, so that arguments and options are similar.
The function takes as input two xarray.DataArray, with a single timestep.

The function will plot as colormap or contour filled map the difference between the two input DataArray (the first one minus the second one).
Additionally a contour line map is plotted with the first input DataArray, to show the original data.

.. figure:: figures/teleconnections_ENSO_correlation_IFS-NEMO_ssp370_lra-r100-monthly_ERA5.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

    Example of a ``plot_single_map_diff()`` output done with the :ref:`teleconnections`.
    The map shows the correlation for the ENSO teleconnection between IFS-NEMO scenario run and ERA5 reanalysis.

Time series
^^^^^^^^^^^

A function called ``plot_timeseries()`` is provided with many options to customize the plot.
The function is built to plot time series of a single variable,
with the possibility to plot multiple lines for different models and a special line for a reference dataset.
The reference dataset can have a representation of the uncertainty over time.

By default the function is built to be able to plot monthly and yearly time series, as required by the :ref:`timeseries` diagnostic.

The function takes as data input:

- **monthly_data**: a (list of) xarray.DataArray, each one representing the monthly time series of a model.
- **annual_data**: a (list of) xarray.DataArray, each one representing the annual time series of a model.
- **ref_monthly_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the monthly time series of the reference dataset.
- **ref_annual_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the annual time series of the reference dataset.
- **std_monthly_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the monthly values of the standard deviation of the reference dataset.
- **std_annual_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the annual values of the standard deviation of the reference dataset.

The function will automatically plot what is available, so it is possible to plot only monthly or only yearly time series, with or without a reference dataset.

.. figure:: figures/timeseries_example_plot.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

    Example of a ``plot_timeseries()`` output done with the :ref:`timeseries`.
    The plot shows the global mean 2 meters temperature time series for the IFS-NEMO scenario and the ERA5 reference dataset.

Seasonal cycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A function called ``plot_seasonalcycle()`` is provided with many options to customize the plot.

The function takes as data input:

- **data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the seasonal cycle of a variable.
- **ref_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the seasonal cycle of the reference dataset.
- **std_data**: a xarray.DataArray representing the standard deviation of the seasonal cycle of the reference dataset.

The function will automatically plot what is available, so it is possible to plot only the seasonal cycle, with or without a reference dataset.

.. figure:: figures/seasonalcycle_example_plot.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

    Example of a ``plot_seasonalcycle()`` output done with the :ref:`timeseries`.
    The plot shows the seasonal cycle of the 2 meters temperature for the IFS-NEMO scenario and the ERA5 reference dataset.

Multiple maps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A function called ``plot_maps()`` is provided with many options to customize the plot.
The function takes as input a list of xarray.DataArray, each one representing a map.
It is built to plot multiple maps in a single figure, with a shared colorbar.
This can be userdefined or evaluated automatically.
Figsize can be adapted and the number of plots and their position is automatically evaluated.

.. figure:: figures/maps_example.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

    Example of a ``plot_maps()`` output.
