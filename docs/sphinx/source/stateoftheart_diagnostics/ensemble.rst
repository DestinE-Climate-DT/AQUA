Ensemble Statistics
===================

Description
-----------

The `Ensemble` module is a tool to perform uncertainty quantification and visualising the ensemble statistics. 
This module contains three classes namely, `EnsembleTimeseries`, `EnsembleLatLon` and `EnsembleZonal`. 

The `EnsembleTimeseries` class takes `1D` timesries as input and performs following functionalities:
- Computes ensemble mean and standatd deviation for monthly and annual timeseries.
- Plots the ensemble mean and \pm along the given timeseries.
- A reference timeseries can also be plotted. 

The `EnsembleLatLon` class takes `2D` `LatLon` `xarray.Dataset` as input and performs the following functionalities:
- Compute ensemble mean and standard deviation for `2D` Maps.
- Plots the ensemble mean and standard deviation separately on two different maps.

The `EnsembleZonal` class take zonal-averages `Lev-Lon` as input and performs the following functionalities:
- Computes ensemble mean and standard deviation of the given input.
- Plots the ensemble mean and standard deviation of the computed statistics. 

Structure
---------

* ``ensemble_class.py``: contains the `EnsembleTimeseries`, `EnsembleLatLon` and `EnsembleZonal` classes.
* ``cli_timeseries_ensemble.py``: the command line interfance (CLI) script to run the ensemble-timeseries diagnostic.
* ``cli_global_2D_ensemble.py``: the command line interfance (CLI) script to run the ensemble-2D-maps in `Lat-Lon` diagnostic.
* ``cli_zonal_ensemble.py``: the command line interfance (CLI) script to run the ensemble-zonal `Lev-Lon` diagnostic.

Input variables
---------------

In order to use the `Ensemble` module, a pre-processing step is required. To load and to merge the input data, `aqua.diagnostics.core.retrieve_merge_ensemble_data` can be used which takes the list of paths of data or uses catalog entries. In this step one has to merge all the given `1D` timeseries, `2D` `Lat-Lon` Map and Zonal-averages `Lev-Lon` for `EnsembleTimeseries`, `EnsembleLatLon` and `EnsembleZonal` along a pesudo-dimension, respectively. The default dimension is simply named as `Ensmbles` and can be changed. One can load the data directly as `xarray.Dataset` or can use the `aqua` `Reader` class. 

The default values for the plotting fuction has been already set as default values. These values can also be by simply defining a python `dictionary` e.g., in the case of the `EnsembleTimeseries`,
``plot_options = {'plot_ensemble_members': True, 'ensemble_label': 'Multi-model', 'plot_title': 'Ensemble statistics for 2-meter temperature [K]', 'ref_label': 'ERA5', 'figure_size': [12,6]}``.

For `EnsembleLatLon`, 
``plot_options = {'figure_size': [15,14], 'cbar_label': '2-meter temperature in K','mean_plot_title': 'Map of 2t for Ensemble Multi-Model mean', 'std_plot_title': 'Map of 2t for Ensemble Multi-Model standard deviation'}``.

For `EnsembleZonal`, 
``plot_options = {'figure_size': [12,8], 'plot_label': True, 'plot_std': True, 'unit': None, 'mean_plot_title': 'Mean of Ensemble of Zonal average', 'std_plot_title':  'Standard deviation of Ensemble of Zonal average', 'cbar_label': 'temperature in K', 'dpi': 300}``.
 
Basic usage
-----------

The basic usage of this diagnostics is explained with working examples in the notebooks provided in ``notebooks/diagnostics/ensemble`` directory. Additionally, a detailed command line interface is also avaiable in ``src/aqua_diagnostics/ensemble`` directory.

Notebooks are stored in ``notebooks/ensemble``:
