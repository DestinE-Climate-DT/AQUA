<details>
  <summary>üìö <span style="color: green;">Homework</span></summary>

1) Implement a time series plot for the tropical band (for example, from -20¬∞ to 20¬∞ latitude).

- Use the `Timeseries` class provided earlier.
- Define latitude boundaries from -20¬∞ to 20¬∞.
- Include data from `1990-01-01` to `1999-12-01`.
- Set standard deviation start and end dates to match the period.

  
<details>
  <summary>üí° <strong><span style="color: orange;">Solution</span></strong></summary>
```python
# 0 s
ts_area = Timeseries(var='2t', models='IFS-NEMO', exps='historical-1990', sources='lra-r100-monthly',
                     startdate='1990-01-01', enddate='1999-12-01',
                     std_startdate='1990-01-01', std_enddate='1999-12-01', extend=False,
                     lat_limits=[-20, 20],
                     loglevel='INFO')
# 1 m, 10 s
ts_area.run()
```
</details>

2) For the same tropical band, compare the **annual mean** of model data with **CERES** reference data.

- Ensure the comparison is made on an annual basis.
- Include CERES data in the comparison as the reference dataset.


3) Generate an annual plot for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) using the `seasonal_bias` function.

- Use `seasonal_bias` to compare two datasets: one for the **IFS-NEMO historical** model and the other for **ERA5**.
- Set the variable to Sea Surface Temperature.
- Define the time periods:
  - **IFS-NEMO**: From `1990-01-01` to `2001-12-31`.
  - **ERA5**: From `1980-01-01` to `2010-12-31`.
- Set the value range between **-4** and **4** and include **9 levels**.
- Generate an **annual** plot.


<details>
  <summary>üí° <strong><span style="color: orange;">Solution</span></strong></summary>

```python
# 13 s
seasonal_bias(
    dataset1=data_ifs_nemo_historical,
    dataset2=data_era5,
    var_name='avg_tos',
    plev=None,
    model_label1='IFS-NEMO historical',
    model_label2='ERA5',

#### 2.4 CLI for a Each AQUA Diagnostic

Each diagnostic has a Command Line Interface (CLI) for running analyses, which includes a Python script and a YAML file to configure the analysis. For example, in the **teleconnections** diagnostic, the Python script is located at [`AQUA/diagnostics/teleconnections/cli/cli_teleconnections.py`](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA/blob/aquathon/diagnostics/teleconnections/cli/cli_teleconnections.py), and the corresponding YAML file is at [`AQUA/diagnostics/teleconnections/cli/cli_config_atm.yaml`](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA/blob/aquathon/diagnostics/teleconnections/cli/cli_config_atm.yaml). This same structure applies to other diagnostics as well.

The CLI scripts include several important features to ensure reliable analysis:

- **Logging**: Tracks the execution of the analysis and records important events.
- **Error handling**: Identifies and manages errors during the process to prevent failures.
- **Metadata for PDF images**: Ensures that the output PDF images are documented with relevant metadata for better traceability.

During AQUA installation, the YAML files are copied to the `.aqua` folder. In your AQUA diagnostics setup, configuration files are organized under the `$HOME/.aqua/diagnostics` directory in a consistent hierarchical structure:

   - **`cli`**: Contains YAML configuration files specific to command-line interfaces for diagnostics.
   - **`config`**: Stores general configuration YAML files for each diagnostic.

<details>
  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <span style="color: red;">Disclaimer</span></summary>

  The configuration files stored under `$HOME/.aqua/diagnostics/` are only retained when the AQUA package is installed in non-development mode. If the package is installed in development mode, symbolic links (symlinks) may be used instead of actual files, pointing to the source files in the development environment.

</details>

---

### 3. **AQUA Analyses Wrapper (5 min)**
---
**Objective**: Demonstrate the aqua-analysis wrapper and how to modify the YAML configuration file.

#### 3.1 Show and Discuss the aqua-analysis Wrapper

The AQUA analyses wrapper is currently implemented as a bash script located at [`$AQUA/cli/aqua-analysis/aqua-analysis.sh`](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA/blob/aquathon/cli/aqua-analysis/aqua-analysis.sh).

- **Automates diagnostics**: Runs multiple diagnostics efficiently.
- **Parallel execution**: Speeds up analyses with multi-process support.
- **Flexible configuration**: Allows customization via command-line and YAML.


<details>
  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <span style="color: red;">Disclaimer</span></summary>
  
  The AQUA wrapper is currently being refactored and **will soon be replaced by a Python script** for improved functionality and flexibility.
  
</details>


#### 3.2 Demonstrate how to modify the YAML file for custom analyses

The YAML file used to configure the wrapper is located at [`$AQUA/cli/aqua-analysis/config.aqua-analysis.yaml`](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA/blob/aquathon/cli/aqua-analysis/config.aqua-analysis.yaml). If you want to customize the settings (different from the default) and run AQUA analyses, you will need to modify this YAML file accordingly.



<details>
  <summary><span style="color: green;">Click to expand YAML Template</span></summary>

```yaml
# Configuration file for aqua-analysis.sh

job:
    max_threads: {{ max_threads, int }}  # Max threads (0 for no limit)
    loglevel: {{ loglevel, str }}  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    run_dummy: {{ run_dummy, bool }}  # Test run with dummy analysis
    outputdir: {{ /path/to/output, str }}  # Output directory path
    model: {{ model_name, str }}  # Model name for analysis
    exp: {{ experiment_name, str }}  # Experiment identifier
    source: {{ source_name, str }}  # Data source identifier

diagnostics:
  run: {{ diagnostics_to_analyze, list }}  # List of diagnostics to run
  diagnostic_name:
    nworkers: {{ nworkers, int }}  # Number of workers
    script_path: {{ script_path, str }}  # Path to diagnostic script
    extra: {{ extra_arguments, str }}  # Additional command-line arguments
    outname: {{ outname, str }}  # Name of output directory
```

#### **`nworkers` Key** 
<details>
  <summary><span style="color: green;">Click to expand</span></summary>

The `nworkers` key defines the number of parallel workers (or processes) used for running diagnostic analyses with Dask. More workers result in faster performance by distributing tasks across multiple CPU cores.

- **Tip**: Set `nworkers` based on the number of available cores on your machine (e.g., 4 or 8 workers for a multi-core system).

This ensures efficient utilization of your computing resources.

</details>

#### **`extra` Key**

<details>
  <summary><span style="color: green;">Click to expand</span></summary>

The `extra` key allows passing additional command-line arguments to the diagnostic script, providing flexibility for customization.

For example, you can:
- Specify a custom configuration file (`--config`).
- Enable reference data analysis (`--ref`).
- Set parameters such as regridding or frequency (`--regrid=r100 --freq=M`).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <span style="color: red;">Disclaimer</span></summary>

  Each diagnostic can have its own `extra` arguments tailored to specific needs, ensuring a flexible and detailed analysis process.

</details>

#### **`outname` Key**

<details>
  <summary><span style="color: green;">Click to expand</span></summary>

The `outname` key specifies the directory name where the output results for a diagnostic will be stored. By default, it uses the diagnostic name, but you can customize it as needed.

For example:
- Setting `outname: global_time_series` will store results in a directory named `global_time_series`.

This ensures that output files are organized in clearly labeled directories, making it easier to manage and access results.

</details>

</details>

### 4. **Running AQUA Analyses (10 min)**
---
**Objective:** Guide participants through the process of executing AQUA analyses using Python and Bash scripts, and submitting the jobs to the SLURM queue for parallel processing. 

#### 4.1 Running the AQUA Analyses CLI for a Specific Diagnostic

To execute the AQUA Analyses CLI for a specific diagnostic using command-line arguments, for example, the `tropical_rainfall` diagnostic:


```bash
 python diagnostics/tropical_rainfall/cli/cli_tropical_rainfall.py 
```

##### Required arguments for CLI:

- `-c`, `--config` (str): Specifies the YAML configuration file to be used. This file contains settings for the diagnostics.
- `-l`, `--loglevel` (str): Defines the logging level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`). Default is `WARNING`.
- `-n`, `--nworkers` (int): Specifies the number of Dask distributed workers for parallel processing.
